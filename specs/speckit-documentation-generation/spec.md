# Feature Specification: Template Documentation System

**Feature Branch**: `speckit-documentation-generation`

**Created**: 2025-10-15

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "Inside of the docs directory, there is a users-doc directory. Inside of the user-docs directory are subdirectories that reflect the template structure in the root directory to the repository. Inside of the user-docs directory, documentation needs to be written for the templates that already exist. For the templates that already exist, there are parameters with displayNames that give additional information about the parameter purpose, the other properties such as defaults, values, type, and name gives additional information about the parameter purpose. The file names of the templates give hints at the purpose of the templates but isn't all inclusive of the functionality. For example, terraform_build.yml inside of the job directory doesn't specify about the terraform validate command, but this is an important part of making sure we have valid terraform files. The requirement here is not writing of further yaml templates, but the writing of the documentation for users to read that will be consuming the templates. This activity is repeatable as more templates are introduced. The documentation that the users read should reference a link to the template that the documentation is too, what other templates it is using itself, and what are the parameters the users can provide to the templates. The Documentation for each template should start with an initial description, then an example of usage, before breaking into a full breakdown of the template and its parameters and usages, plus any further examples. Currently the documentation will be read via github so the use of github markdown additional features is possible."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Template Consumer Discovers Functionality (Priority: P1)

A DevOps engineer needs to understand what the `terraform_build.yml` job template does, what parameters it accepts, and how to use it in their pipeline. They visit the documentation to get complete information about the template's purpose, usage examples, and parameter configuration options.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling template consumers to understand and correctly implement templates without needing to read YAML source code.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating documentation for one template and verifying that a new team member can successfully implement it based solely on the documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a DevOps engineer unfamiliar with the template, **When** they read the template documentation, **Then** they understand the template's purpose and core functionality
2. **Given** a template consumer needs to implement a pipeline, **When** they follow the usage examples in the documentation, **Then** they can successfully configure and use the template
3. **Given** a user wants to customize template behavior, **When** they review the parameter documentation, **Then** they understand all available configuration options and their effects

---

### User Story 2 - Template Consumer Understands Dependencies (Priority: P1)

A pipeline engineer needs to understand which other templates a specific template depends on and how those dependencies affect their implementation. They need clear visibility into the template hierarchy and relationships.

**Why this priority**: Template dependencies are critical for proper implementation and troubleshooting. Misunderstanding dependencies leads to pipeline failures.

**Independent Test**: Documentation clearly shows template dependencies and a user can trace the complete template chain for any given template.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a template uses other templates internally, **When** a user reads the documentation, **Then** they can see all referenced templates and their purposes
2. **Given** a user wants to understand the complete pipeline flow, **When** they follow template dependency links, **Then** they can trace from pipeline level down to individual tasks
3. **Given** a template has changed its dependencies, **When** the documentation is updated, **Then** users see accurate current dependency information

---

### User Story 3 - Template Consumer Configures Parameters (Priority: P2)

A developer needs to customize a template for their specific use case by understanding all available parameters, their data types, default values, and the impact of different configuration choices.

**Why this priority**: Parameter configuration is essential for template flexibility, but incorrect configuration is a common source of pipeline failures.

**Independent Test**: User can successfully configure any template parameter based on documentation without referring to YAML source code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a template has configurable parameters, **When** a user reads the parameter documentation, **Then** they understand each parameter's purpose, type, and default value
2. **Given** a user needs to customize template behavior, **When** they review parameter examples, **Then** they can configure parameters for their specific scenario
3. **Given** a parameter has constraints or validation rules, **When** documented, **Then** users understand valid values and configuration patterns

---

### User Story 4 - Template Consumer Sees Advanced Examples (Priority: P3)

An experienced DevOps engineer wants to implement complex scenarios using templates and needs advanced usage examples beyond basic implementation patterns.

**Why this priority**: Advanced examples enable sophisticated use cases and reduce support burden by providing guidance for complex scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Documentation includes advanced examples that demonstrate real-world complex usage patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a template supports advanced configurations, **When** a user reviews advanced examples, **Then** they can implement complex scenarios
2. **Given** multiple templates work together in sophisticated patterns, **When** documented with examples, **Then** users can replicate enterprise-level implementations
3. **Given** a template has performance or security considerations, **When** documented, **Then** users understand best practices and optimization techniques

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when template parameters are misconfigured or invalid?
- How does the documentation handle templates that reference non-existent dependencies?
- What occurs when template functionality changes but documentation is outdated?
- How should documentation handle deprecated or legacy template versions?
