# Feature Specification: Template Documentation System

**Feature Branch**: `speckit-documentation-generation`

**Created**: 2025-10-15

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "Focus only on documenting pipeline templates in the pipelines/ directory. Each pipeline template will have its own markdown file in user-docs/ with the same filename as the pipeline yml file. Tasks, jobs, and stages templates will be self-documenting through improved YAML comments and metadata. The pipeline documentation should follow a specific layout: Pipeline Name, Overview, Important Notices, Basic Usage with examples and required parameters, Full Usage with parameter tables and advanced usage sections, and Notes. The user-docs README.md will reference these individual pipeline documentation files."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Pipeline Template Consumer Discovers Functionality (Priority: P1)

A DevOps engineer needs to understand what the `infrastructure_pipeline.yml` pipeline template does, what parameters it accepts, and how to use it in their project. They visit the user documentation to get complete information about the pipeline's purpose, usage examples, and parameter configuration options.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling pipeline template consumers to understand and correctly implement pipeline templates without needing to read YAML source code.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating documentation for one pipeline template and verifying that a new team member can successfully implement it based solely on the documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a DevOps engineer unfamiliar with the pipeline template, **When** they read the pipeline documentation, **Then** they understand the pipeline's purpose and core functionality
2. **Given** a template consumer needs to implement a pipeline, **When** they follow the usage examples in the documentation, **Then** they can successfully configure and use the pipeline template
3. **Given** a user wants to customize pipeline behavior, **When** they review the parameter documentation, **Then** they understand all available configuration options and their effects

---

### User Story 2 - Pipeline Template Consumer Understands Implementation Details (Priority: P2)

A pipeline engineer needs to understand the internal structure and implementation notes for pipeline templates, including important notices and advanced usage patterns that may not be immediately obvious from basic parameter documentation.

**Why this priority**: Pipeline templates often have specific requirements, limitations, or advanced features that require clear communication to prevent implementation issues.

**Independent Test**: Documentation includes important notices, advanced usage examples, and implementation notes that help users avoid common pitfalls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pipeline template has specific requirements or limitations, **When** a user reads the important notices section, **Then** they understand critical implementation considerations
2. **Given** a user wants to implement advanced scenarios, **When** they review the advanced usage section, **Then** they can configure complex pipeline behaviors
3. **Given** a pipeline template has common implementation patterns, **When** documented with examples, **Then** users can quickly adopt best practices

---

### User Story 3 - Pipeline Template Consumer Configures Parameters (Priority: P1)

A developer needs to customize a pipeline template for their specific use case by understanding all available parameters, their data types, default values, and the impact of different configuration choices.

**Why this priority**: Parameter configuration is essential for pipeline template flexibility, but incorrect configuration is a common source of pipeline failures.

**Independent Test**: User can successfully configure any pipeline template parameter based on documentation without referring to YAML source code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pipeline template has configurable parameters, **When** a user reads the parameter documentation, **Then** they understand each parameter's purpose, type, and default value
2. **Given** a user needs to customize pipeline behavior, **When** they review parameter examples, **Then** they can configure parameters for their specific scenario
3. **Given** a parameter has constraints or validation rules, **When** documented, **Then** users understand valid values and configuration patterns

---

### User Story 4 - Pipeline Template Documentation Structure Navigation (Priority: P3)

A DevOps engineer wants to easily navigate between different pipeline template documentation and understand the overall structure through a well-organized README.md in the user-docs directory.

**Why this priority**: Clear navigation structure reduces time to find relevant documentation and improves overall user experience.

**Independent Test**: Users can quickly find and access pipeline template documentation through the user-docs README.md structure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple pipeline templates exist, **When** a user visits the user-docs README.md, **Then** they can see all available pipeline templates with clear descriptions
2. **Given** a user needs specific pipeline documentation, **When** they follow links from the README.md, **Then** they can access the appropriate pipeline template documentation
3. **Given** pipeline template documentation follows a standard structure, **When** users navigate between different pipeline docs, **Then** they find consistent layout and information organization

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when template parameters are misconfigured or invalid?
- How does the documentation handle templates that reference non-existent dependencies?
- What occurs when template functionality changes but documentation is outdated?
- How should documentation handle deprecated or legacy template versions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: MUST create individual markdown documentation files for each pipeline template in the pipelines/ directory
- **FR-002**: Documentation files MUST be named identically to their corresponding pipeline YAML files (e.g., infrastructure_pipeline.md for infrastructure_pipeline.yml)
- **FR-003**: Each pipeline documentation MUST follow the specified layout: Pipeline Name, Overview, Important Notices, Basic Usage, Full Usage, and Notes sections
- **FR-004**: Basic Usage section MUST include example usage and required parameters subsections
- **FR-005**: Full Usage section MUST include Full Parameter Table and Advanced Usage subsections with detailed parameter documentation
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST utilize GitHub Markdown features for enhanced readability (tables, collapsible sections, code blocks)
- **FR-007**: The user-docs README.md MUST be updated to reference the individual pipeline documentation files
- **FR-008**: Tasks, jobs, and stages templates MUST be made self-documenting through improved YAML metadata (descriptive names, displayName, parameter types, defaults, value ranges)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- Q: Documentation generation method - automated extraction, manual creation, or hybrid approach? → A: AI agent reads YAML templates and generates comprehensive documentation directly
- Q: Documentation file locations for optimal discoverability and maintenance? → A: Inside of the user-docs directory
- Q: Template source linking method to meet FR-002 requirement? → A: Use markdown links with relative file paths, no urls
- Q: Documentation structure organization within each directory? → A: Concise README.md in user-docs with categorized template links organized by type (pipelines, stages, jobs, tasks)
- Q: Parameter documentation format for best user experience? → A: Markdown table format with links to detailed examples for complex parameters

## Assumptions

- Template parameters with `displayName` properties provide sufficient information to derive user-friendly parameter descriptions
- Template file names and internal comments provide adequate context for determining template purposes
- GitHub Markdown will be the primary consumption method for the documentation
- AI agent can analyze YAML templates to extract all necessary information for comprehensive documentation generation
- Users consuming templates have basic Azure DevOps pipeline knowledge
- Template dependencies can be identified by analyzing `template:` references in YAML files
- Documentation pattern established by AI agent can be replicated for future templates as they are added
