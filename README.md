# Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline Templates

Centralised repository for reusable Azure DevOps (AzDO) YAML pipeline templates used across projects. These templates enforce consistency, compliance, and best practices for building, testing, and deploying workloads on Azure.

## 🎯 Purpose

Provide a **single source of truth** for standardised pipeline templates that:

- Promote reusable and composable pipeline design.
- Enforce security, quality, and compliance checks.
- Support both .NET and platform-agnostic workloads.
- Align with Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) and internal DevOps standards.

## Using the templates

Documentation on the templates appears in two locations:

- The templates themselves; time/effort has been invested to make sure that any parameters have correct displayNames and the file included a small comment section on the template itself
- The [user docs](docs/user-docs/README.md); this provide highlevel documentation regarding the pipelines that are available.

## Contributing to the templates

Outlined in [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
