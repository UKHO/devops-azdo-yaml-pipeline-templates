## Key Guidelines

- **Formatting Standards:** Always follow the formatting rules specified in the `.editorconfig` file at the root of the repository.
- **Understand Breaking Changes:** Refer to the `how-to-version.md` file at the root for rules on what constitutes a breaking change. Always check this document before making modifications to existing templates.
- **YAML Best Practices:** Follow established YAML conventions:
    - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces).
    - Avoid unnecessary complexity.
    - Use descriptive names for parameters, steps, and jobs.
    - Document templates with comments where appropriate.
- **Reusability:** Design templates to be modular and easily consumable by other repositories.
- **Documentation:** Update or create documentation for any new features, changes, or best practices.
